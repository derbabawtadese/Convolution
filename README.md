# Convolution

	1. This program filters high frequency signals above the filter cut-off frequency by convolving the input signal x[n] 
	with FIR filter kernel h[n] using several DSP computation methods:
		a. Direct form
		b. Convolution table
		c. Matrix form
		d. LTI form
	
	2. CPU clock source Freq: @168.00MHz using internal PLL
	3. uController - STM32F407VGTx
